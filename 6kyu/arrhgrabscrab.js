//Arrh, grabscrab!

// Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.

// At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.

// Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.

// For example:

// grabscrab( "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"] )

// Should return ["sport", "ports"].

// Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.

// Good luck!

function grabscrab(anagram, dictionary) {
  let word = anagram

    .sort()
    .join("");
  return dictionary.filter(
    a =>
      a
        .split("")
        .sort()
        .join("") === word
  );
